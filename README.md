# FermiMap

FermiMap is a tool for procedurally generating tilemaps in both text and bitmap forms. It can also generate raw Perlin noise maps. This program allows you to generate tilemaps based on a given seed, width, and height.

## Installation

To use FermiMap, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- [SixLabors.ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp)

You can install the required dependencies using a package manager like NuGet. Once the dependencies are installed, you can compile and run the program.

## Usage

To generate a tilemap using FermiMap, follow these steps:

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a map seed when prompted. The seed determines the randomness of the generated tilemap.
3. Enter the width and height of the room. This determines the size of the tilemap.
4. The program will generate the tilemap using Perlin noise.
5. You will be prompted if you want to see the tilemap. If you choose "Y" or "y", the program will display the tilemap in both text and ASCII forms.
6. You can repeat the process to generate different tilemaps with different seeds and dimensions.
